_Reloaded is an unofficial patch for Splinter Cell Chaos Theory Versus and is compatible with the stock game and [SCCT Enhanced](https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSCCTVersus/releases/)._

#### Featured Changes
* Added a new master server to enable online play (Ubisoft went offline in 2016)

* Added support for high FPS and fixed numerous bugs which made high FPS unusable
* Increased frame timing stability and reduced input lag
* Added a new mouse input system:
  * High polling rate mouse support
  * No negative acceleration
  * Fine control over mouse sensitivity (via console commands)
* Added widescreen support for up to 16:9 monitors (without stretched 3D)
* All resolutions your monitor supports are now selectable in-game
* Fixed rendering bugs (e.g. Merc flashlight)
* Fixed spies rubberbanding when getting shot (due to the adrenaline speed boost)
* Fixed sticky cameras sometimes not firing when spies are in motion

#### Install instructions
1. Go to your `Versus/System` directory
1. Extract the contents of the zip into this directory

#### Extended change log

##### Game Fixes
* Fixed bug where the higher your frame rate, the more the sniper scope bounces up and down (left/right movement is not fixed yet)
* Makes the sniper kick consistent. Some players would have experienced 10x more kick than others before
* Fixes bug where Spies sometimes cannot jump over objects when running at high FPS
* Fixes coop bug where coop moves fail at high FPS
* Fixes bug where grenades appear to drop at the Merc's feet (was caused by lag or host running at over 2x your frame rate)
* Fixes bug where some soft body actors (e.g. hanging fabric) would move forever once disturbed (was much worse at high FPS)
* Fixed high FPS bug where screen shake would last far longer than it should
* Fixes bug where some players had no ambient noise

###### Graphics
* Includes d3d8to9 to add Gsync/Freesync support
* Allows Merc first person FOV to be configured via command line (you cannot go above 112)
* Improves model rendering quality at distance
* Fixes animated textures running too fast at high FPS.  At 100+ FPS they appeared to be flickering
* Fixes bug where the screen flickers repeatedly during profile selection/game launch

###### Networking
* Added UPnP port forwarding for easy hosting
* Server list lets you know if you cannot join a game because they're running a different version of the game (enhanced/stock)
* When searching for LAN games, a packet is now sent the Reloaded Master server to request games and retrieves internet games
  * Display when a new minor (optional) version of Reloaded is available
  * Display when a new major version of Reloaded is available
* When hosting, a registration packet is sent to the Reloaded Master server once per minute to advertise your server
  * Common hosting errors/warnings are displayed in the chat box
  * Display when a new minor (optional) version of Reloaded is available
  * Display when a new major (mandatory) version of Reloaded is available and prevent the server being listed
* Automatically configures your game with network settings which should support hosting at up to 165 FPS

##### Input
* Adds a separate sensitivity control for cameras (e.g. sticky cams)
* Mouse setting has been removed from GUI options and moved to console commands
* Fixes bug where if you move your mouse too fast, the game ignores your movement

##### New console commands
* `fps_client <number>`: Set client FPS between 30 and 240.  Currently 165 and below is recommended due to the merc sniper sway which is only partly fixed
* `fps_host <number>`: FPS limit whilst hosting
* `widescreen <True/False>`: applies widescreen aspect ratio fix
* `ws_fov`: Caps widescreen field of view for people who are sensitive to motion sickness. The default is 105.0 which gives a similar experience to many modern FPS games, but settings up to 112.0 will increase Merc FOV
* `sens <number>`: Mouse sensitivity during gameplay
* `sens_cam <number>`: Mouse sensitivity for cam network and sticky cams
* `sens_menu <number`>: Mouse sensitivity in menus
* `quit`: Exit the game
* `help`: Display all available commands

##### SCCT_Versus.config settings
* `force_max_refresh_rate`: Forces your game to run at your monitor's maximum refresh rate. Prevents bug where your game would flicker repeatedly during launch
* `labs_borderless_fullscreen`: Experimental feature.  Your game will be stuck in the top left corner if you don't use your monitor's native resolution
* `security_dep`: Recommended security feature to improve safety whilst playing online
* `security_acg`: Advanced security feature which may be incompatible with certain software like OBS, so should normally be kept off
* `sticky_camera_fix`: Stops viewing previous sticky cam/exiting when attempting to fire a new camera. This entirely removes the context menu, so you will need to use the previous camera bind
* `override_console_key`: Changes the key to open the console to the number to the left of 1
* `lod`: Determines how far away models become lower quality. The stock game uses 1.0
* `list_on_reloaded_master_server`: Setting to 'false' stops your server from being added to the Reloaded master server list. Wait 1 minute after turning this off to be sure the previous registration has expired
* `server_list`: Specify `IP:PORT` of servers which aren't on the master server. Do not add a `,` after the last IP:PORT you specify.
Example: 
~~~json
"server_list": ["127.0.0.1:7776","192.168.0.1:7776"],
~~~
* `host_port_query`: Port used to respond to ping requests on the server list. Warning: settings other than 7776 will prevent players from joining via LAN/Radmin
* `host_port_game`: Port used when players join your server
* `host_upnp`: Use UPnP to automatically port forward your game. UPnP needs to be enabled on your router to use this feature
* `flashlight_rendering_fix`: Fixes rendering issues with lighting (e.g. the Merc flashlight)
* `client_port_query`: Port used to send ping requests to servers. Warning: settings other than 7776 will prevent you from joining LAN/Radmin games
* `alternate_frame_timing_mode`: May improve frame pacing on some systems, at the expense of increased CPU usage. Most people want this off

##### Miscellaneous
* Enables Data Execution Protection (DEP) by default to enhance online protection
* Adds Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG) as an optional security measure (requires deleting d3d8.dll and not using external capture software)
* Changes the key to open the console to Tilde/backtick (the normal key)
* Changes console font to something legible

##### Launcher
* Opens `SCCT_Versus.ex` and triggers the in-memory patching process
* Warns you if not installed in the correct location
* If using the Ubisoft Connect version of SCCT, will prompt you to run the setup script if you haven't
