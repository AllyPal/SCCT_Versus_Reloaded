_Reloaded is an unofficial patch for Splinter Cell Chaos Theory Versus and is compatible with the stock game and [SCCT Enhanced](https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSCCTVersus/releases/)._

#### Featured Changes
* Added a new master server to enable online play (Ubisoft went offline in 2016)
* Fixed "Instas" where grenades explode before they should
* Added support for high FPS and fixed numerous bugs which made high FPS unusable
* Increased frame timing stability and reduced input lag
* Added a new mouse input system:
  * High polling rate mouse support
  * No negative acceleration
  * Fine control over mouse sensitivity (via console commands)
* Added widescreen support for up to 16:9 monitors (without stretched 3D)
* All resolutions your monitor supports are now selectable in-game
* Fixed rendering bugs (e.g. Merc flashlight)
* Fixed spies rubberbanding when getting shot (due to the adrenaline speed boost)
* Fixed sticky cameras sometimes not firing when spies are in motion
